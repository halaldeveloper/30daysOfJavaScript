# 30daysOfJavaScript

# In the month of March, I decided to relearn JavaScript by spending 2-3 hours everyday, studying, coding & practicing what I've learnt.
# The goal is I want to become proficient with JavaScript, after which I would pick up a framework ReactJS.
# Thank you GitHub and I'll ...see you on the Tech SideðŸ’¯ðŸ˜Ž
